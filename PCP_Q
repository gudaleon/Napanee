Instruction for Downloading Monitoring Data:

1.register at GitHub under university login, indicate a student status to receive free membership.
2. R libraries to download data from Hydat and Weather Canada are at GitHub. 

install.packages("devtools") # If not already installed
devtools::install_github("ropensci/weathercan") 
devtools::install_github("ropensci/tidyhydat") 
#or
devtools::install_github("paleolimbot/hydatr") 

#3. Using ArcGIS select nearby stations for flow and weather;

#4. Use R libraries above to download data for those stations,

#Important - data should be used as data.frames, so use conversion statement :
x<-data.frame(x)

5. Prepare a column for  dates 1970-1-1 till today - it will server as a primary ID for connect with downloaded data from different time periods .

#code
TimeAll=as.integer(365.25*49) #we create sequence of time data for 49 years in daily scale from 1970s till Dec. 31, 2018
df_timeAll <- data.frame(date1 = seq(as.Date('1970-01-01'),by = 'day', len =TimeAll))
#all missing values will receive NA, which we shall change later for NAN for Winbugs use.

5. Using primary ID column you can merge it with  downloaded data from each downloaded station.
   Also rename columne  to include station ID if necessary.
   
# merge two data frames by date column "ID"
total <- merge(df_timeAll,df_Hydat02EC005,by="PK",all.x = TRUE)

6. Save the dataframe as an object for use in Winbugs : 
dput(total, file = "PCP_Q", control = c("keepNA", "keepInteger", "niceNames", "showAttributes"))

#
dget(file, keep.source = FALSE)
